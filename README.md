# EWC Community Hub Items Catalog
This repository hosts the official catalog of [items](./items.yaml) offered in the [EWC Community Hub](https://europeanweather.cloud/about).

## Item's Metadata
> ðŸ’¡ At least the `maintainers[*].email` or the `maintainers[*].url` property value should always be set.
These to ensure end-users of the item can submit inquiries or receive request support, in accordance with the support level offered by the maintainer(s).

The following example shows information that an onboarded item should typically include.
For detailed information on the required and optional metadata, checkout the [catalog schema](./schemas/catalog/v1alpha1.json).

## Schema Validation
> ðŸ’¡ To learn more about how you can onboard your item into the catalog, please check the [official EWC documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Contributing+a+new+Item+to+the+EWC+Community+Hub).

This repository relies on [GitHub](./.github/workflows/validate.yml) actions to automate the process of catalog/item metadata validation.
The pipelines are configured to run upon pull request opening, subject to approval of the maintainers.

### Running Locally

If you wish to validate changes to the metadata on your own, you can emulate the steps performed by the automation.
Make sure your working environment has [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.
Then, to validate any changes in the metadata against the expected schema, simply run:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v .:/tmp:ro \
  weibeld/ajv-cli:5.0.0 \
  ajv \
  -s tmp/schemas/catalog/v1alpha1.json \
  -d /tmp/items.yaml \
  -c ajv-formats \
  --spec draft2020
```

If changes comply, you should see a successful run message like:
```
/tmp/items.yaml valid
```
