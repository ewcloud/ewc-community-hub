      version: "1.1.0"
      description: |
        >⚠️ In the past this functionality has been provided out-of-the-box for all
        EWC tenancies running on the EUMETSAT site. However, this is no longer the
        case; after October 2025, EWC tenant admins wishing to integrate IPA enrollment
        with Morpheus VM provisioning can use this template to enable said functionality
        for newly onboarded tenancies, on both EUMETSAT or ECMWF sites.

        [IPA (identity, policy and audit)](https://www.freeipa.org/) is a software stack that serves both as an LDAP user
        management system and as your internal DNS nameserver.

        [Morpheus UI](https://docs.morpheusdata.com/en/7.0.9),
        on the other hand, is a web-based cloud orchestration tool that lets you manage
        your EWC resources via a graphical interface. It has built-in
        [Automation](https://docs.morpheusdata.com/en/7.0.9/library/automation/automation.html)
        features you may use for arranging sets of individual Tasks and accomplishing
        some useful behavior, when managing with cloud resources via Morpheus.

        This configuration template
        (i.e. an [Ansible Playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks.html))
        customizes your environment in the
        [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/), such that it
        crates a Morpheus Automation to simplify the administration of a fleet of IPA-aware EWC compute instances.

        ## Functionality
        > 💡 To provision and configure a VM as an IPA server from scratch and with
        fully-managed state (i.e. safe for resizing or upgrading),
        you may deploy the [IPA Server Provisioning](https://europeanweather.cloud/community-hub/ipa-server-provisioning)
        Community Hub Item.

        > 💡 To configure an existing VM as an IPA server,
        you can deploy the [IPA Server Flavour](https://europeanweather.cloud/community-hub/ipa-server-flavour)
        Community Hub Item.

        Once an IPA server is successfully provisioned
        and configured within your EWC environment, this template reduces the
        Morpheus configuration required to achieve the following behavior:
        * New VMs created via the Morpheus UI, within
        a user-defined Morpheus Network Domain, will enroll onto an IPA server's
        provided DNS and LDAP services, enabling users to log into any VM with
        the same username and password.

        ![Automatic VM Enroll](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewcloud/ewc-ansible-playbook-ipa-enroll-automation-via-morpheus/refs/heads/main/docs/images/outcome_part1.webp)

        * Users may access any newly enrolled VMs with their existing LDAP credentials.

        ![Access via LDAP Credentials](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewcloud/ewc-ansible-playbook-ipa-enroll-automation-via-morpheus/refs/heads/main/docs/images/outcome_part2.webp)

        * Enrolled VMs will disenroll from the IPA server upon
        their deletion via Morpheus UI, to ensure a clean and healthy internal DNS
        table.

        ## Prerequisites

        * Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (version 2.0 or higher )
        * Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads) (version 3.9 or higher)
        * Install [ansible](https://pypi.org/project/ansible) (version 2.15 or higher)
        * Install [jmespath](https://pypi.org/project/jmespath) (version 1.0 or higher)
        * Get an Morpheus API credentials (see [API access](https://docs.morpheusdata.com/en/7.0.9/administration/user_settings/user_settings.html#api-access) section in the official Morpheus documentation)

        ## Usage

        ### 1. Clone the repository

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/ewcloud/ewc-ansible-playbook-ipa-enroll-automation-via-morpheus.git
        ```

        #### 1.1. Change to the specific Item's subdirectory

        ```bash
        cd ewc-ansible-playbook-ipa-enroll-automation-via-morpheus
        ```

        #### 1.2. (Optional) Checkout an specific Item's version
        >⚠️ Make sure to replace `x.y.z` in the command below, with your version of preference.

        ```bash
        git checkout x.y.z
        ```

        ### 2. Configure and apply the template

        ![Template Edition and Running](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewcloud/ewc-ansible-playbook-ipa-enroll-automation-via-morpheus/refs/heads/main/docs/images/item_run_part1.webp)

        #### 2.1. Interactive Mode

        By running the following command, you can trigger an interactive session that
        prompts you for the necessary user inputs, and then applies changes to your
        target EWC environment:
        ```bash
        ansible-playbook ipa-enroll-automation.yml
        ```

        #### 2.2. Non-Interactive Mode

        >💡 To learn more about defining variables at runtime, checkout the
        [official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html).

        You can also run in non-interactive mode by passing the `--extra-vars` or `-e` flag, followed by a map of key-value pairs; one for each and every available input (see [inputs](#inputs) section below). For example:
        ```bash
        ansible-playbook \
          -e '{ "morpheus_api_token":"<api-token>",
                "morpheus_api_url":"https://morpheus.ecmwf.int",
                "morpheus_tenant_name":"eumetsat-sandbox-ewc",
                "update_morpheus_cypher":"yes",
                "morpheus_cypher_ipa_domain":"eumetsat.sandbox.ewc",
                "morpheus_cypher_ipa_server_hostname":"ipa-server-1",
                "morpheus_cypher_ipa_admin_username":"ipaadmin",
                "morpheus_cypher_ipa_admin_password":"my-secret-password"
          }' \
          ipa-enroll-automation.yml
        ```

        ### 3. Manually link the Morpheus Workflow to the user-defined Morpheus Domain
        >⚠️ As of 17.07.2025, technical limitations on the side of the
        [Morpheus API](https://apidocs.morpheusdata.com/v7.0.9/reference/createnetworkdomain)
        lead to unreliable configuration of links between workflows and domains.
        As a workaround, manual action over the Morpheus UI is required.

        > ⛔ This step must be performed every time you update the template input values and
        apply them.

        ![Morpheus Domain and Workflow linking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewcloud/ewc-ansible-playbook-ipa-enroll-automation-via-morpheus/refs/heads/main/docs/images/item_run_part2.webp)

        Finalize the configuration over the Morpheus UI:

        1. Login to the Morpheus UI of your EWC environment
        2. From the top navigation bar, go to `Infrastructure > Network`.
        3. Select `Domains` from the sub navigation bar.
        4. A table will be displayed in the lower portion of the view port, and
        containing details of available domains in your EWC environment. Click on the
        edit icon (`🖉`) on the same row where your defined domain is listed.
        5. Within the pop-up edit form, click on the `Select Workflow` drop-down
        menu and select `IPA Client Enroll Automation Via Morpheus`.
        6. Click on `SAVE CHANGES` at the
        bottom of the form to finalize the setup.

        ### 4. (Optional) Further integrate your IPA Server with Morpheus Monitoring

        ![Morpheus Agent Installation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewcloud/ewc-ansible-playbook-ipa-enroll-automation-via-morpheus/refs/heads/main/docs/images/openstack_cli_intro_webminar.jpg)

        VMs provisioned via Morpheus UI, such as the ones you may have created
        before applying this template or those you'll create afterwards (which
        will automatically become part of your IPA-managed fleet), are equipped with a
        [Morpheus Agent](https://docs.morpheusdata.com/en/7.0.9/getting_started/functionality/agent/overview.html),
        a daemon that provide statistics for the guest operating system and resource utilization,
        to enable monitoring and log aggregations.

        If you are fond of such Morpheus monitoring functionality,
        watch [minutes
        40:22-44:10 of this EWC webminar](https://youtu.be/MO3pYzSDQSM?feature=shared&t=2422)
        to learn about how you can turn instances provisioned via Community Hub Item templating,
        or alternative deployment methods, into Morpheus-monitored VMs.

        ## Inputs
        >⚠️ If set, the `update_morpheus_cypher` flag will trigger the creation/edition of secrets within Morpheus Cypher.
        To avoid unexpected behavior during IPA clients enrollment, ensure the values of all input secrets (i.e. those with
        `morpheus_cypher_` prefix) are set and match to the values used during the initial IPA server configuration in your
        EWC environment.

        > 💡 The module supports complex rule sets, such as those required to create a subnet security group for IPA services (i.e. Kerberos, LDAP and DNS).

        This Terraform module creates and configures an OpenStack Security Group with a user-defined set of rules. It is designed to be reusable, flexible, and aligned with Terraform best practices for OpenStack deployments.

        More specifically, the module:
        * Creates an OpenStack Security Group with customizable name and description.
        * Attaches an arbitrary number of user-defined rules to the security group.

        ## Usage

        ```hcl
        module "ipa_security_group" {
          source = "/path/to/terraform/module"

          security_group_name = "ipa"

          security_group_rules = [

        This Ansible Playbook configures an existing virtual machine running
        within the [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/), to equip it with the Data Tailor Standalone and EUMETSAT Data Access Client (EUMDAC).

        ## Functionality
        > 💡 Unlike the Data Tailor Web Services (DTWS), which can be used with EUMDAC or via https://tailor.eumetsat.int, the standalone version is generally faster and does not have limitations such as maximum concurrent jobs or workspace size.

        The Data Tailor is a product customization toolbox designed to:
        * Enable users to tailor satellite data to their specific needs.
        * Offers the ability to subset and aggregate data products across space and time, filter layers, generate quick looks, reproject data onto new coordinate reference systems, and reformat data into widely used Geographic Information System (GIS) formats such as netCDF and GeoTIFF, as well as image formats like JPEG and PNG.
        * Customize data from various satellite collections, including METOP, MFG ,MSG, MTG (Meteosat Third Generation) and Sentinel-3.

        For more information on capabilities of the Data Tailor, please refer to [Data Tailor Standalone Guide on User Portal](https://user.eumetsat.int/resources/user-guides/data-tailor-standalone-guide) and for more information about the available products and customizations inside the Data Tailor, please go to [Products and Customizations Available in the Data Tailor](https://user.eumetsat.int/resources/user-guides/data-store-detailed-guide#ID-Products-and-customisation-available-in-the-Data-Tailor) page.

        ## Prerequisites
        > 💡 A VM plan with at least 16GB of RAM is recommended for successful setup and
        stable operation.

        * Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (version 2.0 or higher )
        * Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads) (version 3.9 or higher)
        * Install [ansible](https://pypi.org/project/ansible) (version 2.15 or higher)
        * If you plan to configure an existing VM, jump to the [Usage](#usage) section below
        * If you have not yet provisioned a VM, it is required to do so. You may choose one of the following approaches:
          * A) Provision a new VM via UI:
            * Create an SSH keypair (see [Creating the keys](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Add+your+SSH+key+pair+to+Morpheus#AddyourSSHkeypairtoMorpheus-Creatingthekeys) section of the EWC documentation)
            * Import the SSH public key into Morpheus (see [Adding the keys in Morpheus](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Add+your+SSH+key+pair+to+Morpheus#AddyourSSHkeypairtoMorpheus-AddingthekeysinMorpheus) section of the EWC documentation)
            * Provision a new VM through the web portal (see [Provision a new Instance - Web](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Provision+a+new+instance+-+web) section of the EWC) documentation

            OR
          * B) Provision a new VM via CLI:
            * Create an SSH keypair (see [Creating the keys](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Add+your+SSH+key+pair+to+Morpheus#AddyourSSHkeypairtoMorpheus-Creatingthekeys) section of the EWC documentation)
            * Add you SSH public key to OpenStack (see [Import SSH Key](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+OpenStack+Command-Line+client#EWCOpenStackCommandLineclient-ImportSSHkey) section of the EWC documentation).
            * Provision a new VM via the OpenStack CLI (see [How to create a VM using the OpenStack CLI](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+How+to+create+a+VM+using+the+Openstack+CLI) section of the EWC documentation)

            OR
          * C) Deploy this template, together with a new VM, via the [EWCCLI](https://pypi.org/project/ewccli/)


        ## Usage

        ### 1. Clone the repository

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/ewcloud/ewc-ansible-playbook-flavours-and-provisioning.git
        ```

        #### 1.1. Change to the specific Item's subdirectory

        ```bash
        cd ewc-ansible-playbook-flavours-and-provisioning/playbooks/eumetsat-data-tailor-flavour
        ```

        #### 1.2. (Optional) Checkout an specific Item's version
        >⚠️ Make sure to replace `x.y.z` in the command below, with your version of preference.

        ```bash
        git checkout x.y.z
        ```

        ### 2. Download  Ansible dependencies
        >💡 By default, Ansible Roles are installed under the `~/.ansible/roles` directory within your working environment.

        Download the correct version of the Ansible dependencies, if you haven't done so already:

        ```
        ansible-galaxy role install -r requirements.yml
        ```

        ### 3. Specify the target host and SSH credentials
        Create an inventory file to specify address/credentials that Ansible should use
        to reach the virtual machine you wish to configure:

        ```yaml
        # inventory.yml
        ---
        ewcloud:
          hosts:
            data_tailor:
              ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
              ansible_host: <add the IPV4 address of the target host>
              ansible_ssh_private_key_file: <add the path to local SSH private key file>
              ansible_user: <add the default user according to your chosen VM image>
              ansible_ssh_common_args: -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new
        ```

        ### 4. Configure and apply the template

        #### 4.1. Interactive Mode

        By running the following command, you can trigger an interactive session that
        prompts you for the necessary user inputs, and then applies changes to your
        target EWC environment:

        ```bash
        ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml eumetsat-data-tailor-flavour.yml
        ```

        #### 4.2. Non-Interactive Mode

        >💡 To learn more about defining variables at runtime, checkout the
        [official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html).

        You can also run in non-interactive mode by passing the
        `--extra-vars` or `-e` flag, followed by a map of  key-value pairs; one for
        each and every available input (see [inputs section](#inputs) below). For
        example:

        ```bash
        ansible-playbook \
          -i inventory.yml \
          -e '{
              "data_tailor_env_wipe": "no",

        This GitHub Action setups all necessary OpenStack resources for a Ansible Playbook to run,  executes it and reports about its success/failure in a nice looking summary (within GitHub UI), as well as machine-friendly artifacts for postprocessing.

        Runs with user-defined `Python` and `Ansible` versions, extra variable inputs and any `Ansible Roles` a test scenario may require.

        ## What's new

        - Added compatibility with the [ewc-community-hub](https://github.com/ewcloud/ewc-community-hub) repository to enable upstream test orchestration and by enforcing naming and formatting convention of workflow inputs.

        ## Prerequisites

        * Get OpenStack API credentials (see [How to request OpenStack Application Credentials](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/x/TiRNH) section of the EWC documentation)
        * Extract the following attributes from your app credentials and store them within your repository's GitHub secrets (see [Creating secrets for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-secrets#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) section of the GitHub documentation):
            - `OS_AUTH_URL`
            - `OS_REGION_NAME`
            - `OS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_ID`
            - `OS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_SECRET`
        * Create an SSH keypair (see [Generating a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent?platform=linux#generating-a-new-ssh-key) section of the GitHub documentation )
        * Add you SSH public key to OpenStack (see [Import SSH Key](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/x/TyRNH) section of the EWC documentation).
        * Once more, update your repository's GitHub secrets to include the value of the private ssh key as:
            - `ANSIBLE_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`

        >✅ This template can be safely applied from any local work environment, even running outside an EWC tenancy's private network.

        The default stack provides an integrated environment for secure access and centralized management in the [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/). It orchestrates the deployment of an IPA server for LDAP and DNS functionality, an SSH bastion for access from the public internet, and a remote desktop for graphical interfacing, while ensuring both the bastion and desktop are enrolled as clients to the IPA server to centralize authentication, authorization, and resource discovery.

        This configuration template (i.e., an [Ansible Playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks.html)) builds upon the individual templates for [IPA server](https://europeanweather.cloud/community-hub/ipa-server-provisioning), [SSH bastion](https://europeanweather.cloud/community-hub/ssh-bastion-provisioning), [remote desktop](https://europeanweather.cloud/community-hub/remote-desktop-provisioning), and [IPA client](https://europeanweather.cloud/community-hub/ipa-client-enroll-flavour) to automate their deployment and integration.

        ![Overview Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ewcloud/ewc-ansible-playbook-flavours-and-provisioning/refs/heads/main/playbooks/default-stack-provisioning/docs/images/default-stack.png)

        ## Functionality
        The template is designed to:

        * Provision the IPA server instance via Terraform, including network validation and automatic subnet DNS updates to enable centralized user management and resource discovery across the environment.
        * Provision the SSH bastion instance via Terraform, configured as a secure entrypoint with intrusion prevention.
        * Enroll the newly provisioned SSH bastion as an IPA client, connecting it to the IPA server for centralized credentials and DNS resolution.
        * Provision the remote desktop instance via Terraform, equipped for graphical access over varying bandwidths.
        * Enroll the newly provisioned remote desktop as an IPA client, integrating it with the IPA server for unified access control.

        After successful provisioning, you can leverage Terraform's functionality to modify or delete individual components safely. Each will have its own `main.tf` definition and `terraform.tfstate` state file under the corresponding user-defined local directories.

        To learn the basics about managing infrastructure with Terraform, check out [Terraform in 100 seconds](https://youtu.be/tomUWcQ0P3k?si=CJwZJ7UaqpynDU-d) on YouTube. You can also find a step-by-step example applied to the EWC on the [official EWC documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/x/2EDOIQ).

        >⚠️ Successful execution leads to changes of the DNS nameserver(s) in your
        OpenStack subnet (includes now only the IP address of the new IPA server).
        This can negatively affect existing VMs within your subnet.
        To prevent issues, programmatically update each VM via the
        [IPA Client Enroll Flavour](https://europeanweather.cloud/community-hub/ipa-client-enroll-flavour)
        CommunityHub Item. Alternatively, you can manually
        [add the new nameserver](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/identity_management_guide/domain-dns)
        to their DNS configuration.

        ## Prerequisites

        * Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (version 2.0 or higher )
        * Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads) (version 3.9 or higher)
        * Install [ansible](https://pypi.org/project/ansible) (version 2.15 or higher)
        * Install [terraform](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+IaC+via+Terraform+and+OpenTofu#EWCIaCviaTerraformandOpenTofu-InstallationoftheCLI) (version 1.0 or higher)
        * Get OpenStack API credentials (see [How to request OpenStack Application Credentials](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+How+to+request+Openstack+Application+Credentials) section of the EWC documentation)
        * Create an SSH keypair (see [Creating Keys](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Add+your+SSH+key+pair+to+Morpheus#AddyourSSHkeypairtoMorpheus-Creatingthekeys) section of the EWC documentation)
        * Import your public SSH key to OpenStack (see [Import SSH Key](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+OpenStack+Command-Line+client#EWCOpenStackCommandLineclient-ImportSSHkey) section of the EWC documentation).

        ## Usage
        > ⚠️ Only RockyLinux versions 9 or 8 are supported due
        to constrains imposed by [dependencies](#dependencies).

        > 💡 VM plans with at least 4GB of RAM is recommended for successful setup and stable operation

        >⛔ Execution of this template can potentially affect DNS resolution on existing VMs within your subnet. To prevent issues, enroll them to the new IPA server via the
        [IPA Client Enroll Flavour](https://europeanweather.cloud/community-hub/ipa-client-enroll-flavour)
        CommunityHub Item, OR manually [edit nameservers in their DNS configuration](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/identity_management_guide/domain-dns).

        This Ansible Playbook configures an existing virtual machine in the
        [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/) to operate as a
        client of [IPA services](../ipa-server-flavour/).

        IPA provides integrated identity management and DNS services, enabling
        centralized user authentication, authorization, and resource discovery.

        Suitable for tenant admins and tenant users alike, this template simplifies the
        integration of VMs into a [FreeIPA](https://www.freeipa.org/page/Main_Page)-managed
        fleet of instances within the EWC environment. Follow the [instructions below](#usage)
        to enroll your instance.

        ## Functionality
        The template is designed to:
        - Configure a pre-existing virtual machine running Rocky Linux 8/9 or Ubuntu to connect to a
        IPA server on the same subnet.
        - Enable DNS resolution for discovering private hosts and public addresses.
        - Allow remote access to the VM using centrally managed LDAP users via password authentication.

        ## Prerequisites
        > ⚠️ Only Ubuntu version 24 and 22, or RockyLinux versions 9 or 8 supported due to constrains imposed by [dependencies](#dependencies).

        This Ansible Playbook configures an existing virtual machine in the
        [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/) to disenroll
        from a [IPA server](../ipa-server-flavour/).

        IPA provides integrated identity management and DNS services for centralized
        user authentication, authorization, and resource discovery. This template safely
        removes a VM from a [FreeIPA](https://www.freeipa.org/page/Main_Page)-managed
        environment, which is essential when decommissioning infrastructure to prevent
        stale entries in the IPA directory—such as obsolete host records, and DNS
        pointers—that could lead to management overhead, naming conflicts or security
        vulnerabilities from lingering credentials.

        Suitable for both tenant admin and tenant users, this template streamlines client
        removal, ensuring a clean and efficient identity system. The end benefit for
        users is reduced administrative burden, improved security posture,
        and easier scaling or redeployment of resources. Follow the [instructions below](#usage)
        to disenroll your instance.

        ## Functionality
        The template is designed to:
        - Configure a pre-existing virtual machine, previously enrolled (likely with help of the [IPA client](../ipa-client-enroll-flavour/) template) to disconnect from an [IPA server](../ipa-server-flavour/).
        - Disable user authentication and authorization (LDAP) for the target instance.
        - Remove IPA server-internal DNS records referencing the target instance, if present.


        ## Prerequisites

        * Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (version 2.0 or higher )
        * Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads) (version 3.9 or higher)
        * Install [ansible](https://pypi.org/project/ansible) (version 2.15 or higher)
        * You require an existing VM already enrolled into your IPA Server.
        * Your require SSH access to the exiting VM (i.e. your public SSH key must be registered on the target machine)

        >✅ This template can be applied from any local work environment, even running outside an EWC tenancy's private network.

        This is a configuration template
        (i.e. an [Ansible Playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks.html))
        to customize your environment in the
        [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/).

        ## Functionality

        The template is designed to:

        * Provision an instance via [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform),
        with your specified Linux distribution and desired flavor (a.k.a VM plan):
          * If a `terraform.tfstate` [state file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state)
          is not found under the user-defined directory, attempts to create the
          instance from scratch

            OR
          * If  `terraform.tfstate` file is found, leverages Terraform's out-of-the-box
          functionality to update the instance referenced on it
        * Configure the existing or newly provisioned instance to connect to an IPA
        server running on the same subnet, such that it:
          * Is remotely accessible via public key or password to centrally
            managed LDAP users
          * Is able to leverage DNS resolution and discover other private
            hosts or public addresses

        After successful provisioning, you can leverage Terraform's functionality to modify or delete individual components safely. Each will have its own `main.tf` definition and `terraform.tfstate` state file under the corresponding user-defined local directories.

        To learn the basics about managing infrastructure with Terraform, check out [Terraform in 100 seconds](https://youtu.be/tomUWcQ0P3k?si=CJwZJ7UaqpynDU-d) on YouTube. You can also find a step-by-step example applied to the EWC on the [official EWC documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/x/2EDOIQ).

        to customize your environment in the
        [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/).

        ## Functionality

        The template is designed to run on an existing virtual machine, running an
        [IPA client](https://www.freeipa.org/page/Client) previously enrolled in
        your IPA server, such that it:

        * Checks if a `terraform.tfstate`[state file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state)
          for the target instance is available under the user-defined directory
        * Requests configuration changes to said IPA server for:
          * Stopping user authentication/authorization management (LDAP) to target
          instance
          * Deletion of IPA server-internal DNS records referencing  the target
          instance machine, if and when found
        * Teardown the target instance and any attached volumes or IP addresses.

        After successful provisioning, you can leverage Terraform's functionality to modify or delete individual components safely. Each will have its own `main.tf` definition and `terraform.tfstate` state file under the corresponding user-defined local directories.

        This Ansible Playbook configures an existing virtual machine running
        within the [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/)
        to operate as a [FreeIPA](https://www.freeipa.org/page/Main_Page) server.

        IPA (acronym for identity, policy and audit), provides integrated identity
        management and DNS services, enabling centralized user authentication, authorization,
        and resource discovery.

        Ideal for tenant administrators, this template simplifies the setup
        of a secure, open-source identity and DNS solution in the EWC environment. Follow the
        [instructions below](#usage) to configure your server.

        ## Functionality
        The template is designed to:
        * Validate that network/subnet configuration in the EWC tenancy
        * Configure a pre-existing virtual machine running RockyLinux version 8 or 9,
        and with a minimum recommended 4GB of RAM, such that it:
          * Provides DNS resolutions for discovery of resources (i.e. other virtual
          machines)
          * Enables centralized user and credentials creation/edition/deletion/authentication
          * Allows centralized authorization between users and resources

        ## Prerequisites

        > ⚠️ Only RockyLinux version 8 is supported due
        to constrains imposed by [dependencies](#dependencies).

        > 💡 A VM plan with at least 4GB of RAM is recommended for successful setup and
        stable operation.

        * Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (version 2.0 or higher )
        * Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads) (version 3.9 or higher)
        * Install [ansible](https://pypi.org/project/ansible) (version 2.15 or higher)
        * Get OpenStack API credentials (see [How to request OpenStack Application Credentials](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+How+to+request+Openstack+Application+Credentials) section of the EWC documentation)
        * If you plan to configure an existing VM, jump to the [Usage](#usage) section below
        * If you have not yet provisioned a VM, it is required to do so. You may choose one of the following approaches:
          * A) Provision a new VM via UI:
            * Create an SSH keypair (see [Creating the keys](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Add+your+SSH+key+pair+to+Morpheus#AddyourSSHkeypairtoMorpheus-Creatingthekeys) section of the EWC documentation)
            * Import the SSH public key into Morpheus (see [Adding the keys in Morpheus](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Add+your+SSH+key+pair+to+Morpheus#AddyourSSHkeypairtoMorpheus-AddingthekeysinMorpheus) section of the EWC documentation)
            * Provision a new VM through the web portal (see [Provision a new Instance - Web](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Provision+a+new+instance+-+web) section of the EWC) documentation

            OR
          * B) Provision a new VM via CLI:
            * Create an SSH keypair (see [Creating the keys](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Add+your+SSH+key+pair+to+Morpheus#AddyourSSHkeypairtoMorpheus-Creatingthekeys) section of the EWC documentation)
            * Add you SSH public key to OpenStack (see [Import SSH Key](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+OpenStack+Command-Line+client#EWCOpenStackCommandLineclient-ImportSSHkey) section of the EWC documentation).
            * Provision a new VM via the OpenStack CLI (see [How to create a VM using the OpenStack CLI](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+How+to+create+a+VM+using+the+Openstack+CLI) section of the EWC documentation)

            OR
          * C) Deploy this template, together with a new VM, as part of the [IPA Server Provisioning Community Hub Item](https://europeanweather.cloud/community-hub/ipa-server-provisioning)

            OR
          * D) Deploy this template, together with a new VM, via the [EWCCLI](https://pypi.org/project/ewccli/)


        ## Usage

        ### 1. Clone the repository

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/ewcloud/ewc-ansible-playbook-flavours-and-provisioning.git
        ```

        #### 1.1. Change to the specific Item's subdirectory

        ```bash
        cd ewc-ansible-playbook-flavours-and-provisioning/playbooks/ipa-server-flavour
        ```

        #### 1.2. (Optional) Checkout an specific Item's version
        >⚠️ Make sure to replace `x.y.z` in the command below, with your version of preference.

        ```bash
        git checkout x.y.z
        ```

        ### 2. Download  Ansible dependencies
        >💡 By default, Ansible Roles are installed under the `~/.ansible/roles` directory within your working environment.

        Download the correct version of the Ansible dependencies, if you haven't done so already:

        ```
        ansible-galaxy role install -r requirements.yml
        ```

        ### 3. Specify the target host and SSH credentials
        Create an inventory file to specify address/credentials that Ansible should use
        to reach the virtual machine you wish to configure:

        ```yaml
        # inventory.yml
        ---
        ewcloud:
          hosts:
            ipa_server:
              ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
              ansible_host: <add the IPV4 address of the target host>
              ansible_ssh_private_key_file: <add the path to local SSH private key file>
              ansible_user: cloud-user
              ansible_ssh_common_args: -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new
        ```

        ### 4. Configure and apply the template

        #### 4.1. Interactive Mode

        By running the following command, you can trigger an interactive session that
        prompts you for the necessary user inputs, and then applies changes to your
        target EWC environment:

        ```bash
        ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml ipa-server-flavour.yml
        ```

        #### 4.2. Non-Interactive Mode

        >💡 To learn more about defining variables at runtime, checkout the
        [official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html).

        You can also run in non-interactive mode by passing the
        `--extra-vars` or `-e` flag, followed by a map of  key-value pairs; one for
        each and every available input (see [inputs section](#inputs) below). For
        example:

        ```bash
        ansible-playbook \
          -i inventory.yml \
          -e '{
              "ipa_domain": "eumetsat.sandbox.ewc",
              "ipa_server_hostname": "ipa-server-1",
              "ipa_admin_username": "ipaadmin",
              "ipa_admin_password": "my-secret-password",
              "ipa_admin_givenname": "EWC",
              "ipa_admin_surname": "IPAADMIN",
              "os_network_name": "private",
              "os_security_group_name": "ipa"
            }' \
          ipa-server-flavour.yml
        ```

        ### 5. Manullay update DNS nameserver(s)

        >⛔ Changes described in this section can potentially affect DNS resolution on existing VMs within your subnet. To prevent issues, enroll them to the new IPA server via the
        [IPA Client Enroll Flavour](https://europeanweather.cloud/community-hub/ipa-client-enroll-flavour)
        CommunityHub Item, OR manually [edit nameservers in their DNS configuration](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/identity_management_guide/domain-dns).

        After successful execution of the template, additional changes to the OpenStack subnet are required.
        You can edit your specific OpenStack subnet, as well as any other OpenStack resource, with the native [OpenStack CLI](pypi.org/project/python-openstackclient/).

        First, take note of the IP address of your newly configured IPA server and the subnet attached to it, replace these information in the command below, and execute:

        ```bash
        openstack subnet set \
          --dns-nameserver <IPV4 address of the IPA server> \
          <ID or name of the OpenStack Subnet attached to the IPA server>
        ```
        Then remove any default DNS nameservers which where added to the subnet prior to the IPA server configuration:

        ```bash
        openstack subnet unset \
          --dns-nameserver <IPV4 address of any prior default DNS nameserver> \
          <ID or name of the OpenStack Subnet attached to the IPA server>
        ```

        ## Inputs

        | Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
        |------|-------------|------|---------|----------|
        | ipa_domain | domain name to be managed by the IPA server. Example: `eumetsat.sandbox.ewc` | `string` | n/a | yes |
        | ipa_server_hostname | hostname of the target vm where the IPA server will be installed | `string`| `ipa-server-1` | yes |
        | ipa_admin_username | username of administrator account to replace the default IPA admin | `string` | `ipaadmin` | yes |
        | ipa_admin_password | password of administrator account to replace the default IPA admin. Example: `my-secret-password` | `string` | n/a | yes |
        | ipa_admin_givenname | given name of the administrator to replace the default IPA admin (not necessarily a real person's name) | `string` | `EWC` | yes |
        | ipa_admin_surname | surname of the administrator to replace the default IPA admin (not necessarily a real person's name) | `string` | `IPAADMIN` | yes |
        | os_network_name | OpenStack network to which the target virtual machine has access to | `string` | `private` | yes |
        | os_security_group_name | OpenStack security group containing all firewall rules required by the IPA server/client communication | `string` | `ipa` | yes |

        >✅ This template can be safely applied from any local work environment, even running outside an EWC tenancy's private network.

        IPA (acronym for identity, policy and audit) and its open-source
        implementation [FreeIPA](https://www.freeipa.org/page/Main_Page), serve
        both as a user management system and as your internal DNS nameserver.

        This is a configuration template
        (i.e. an [Ansible Playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks.html))
        to customize your environment in the
        [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/).

        ## Functionality

        The template is designed to:

        * Provision an instance via [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform),
        with your specified VM image and desired flavor (a.k.a VM plan):
          * If a `terraform.tfstate` [state file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state)
          is not found under the user-defined directory, attempts to create the
          instance from scratch

            OR
          * If a `terraform.tfstate` file is found, leverages Terraform's out-of-the-box
          functionality to update the instance referenced on it
        * Validate that network/subnet configuration in the EWC tenancy
        * Configure the existing or newly provisioned instance such that it:
          * Provides DNS resolutions for discovery of resources (i.e. other virtual machines)
          * Enables centralized user and credentials creation/edition/deletion/authentication
          * Allows centralized authorization between users and resources
        * Automatically update the underlying subnet DNS nameserver to point to the
        newly configured IPA server

        After successful provisioning, you can leverage Terraform's functionality to modify or delete individual components safely. Each will have its own `main.tf` definition and `terraform.tfstate` state file under the corresponding user-defined local directories.

        To learn the basics about managing infrastructure with Terraform, check out [Terraform in 100 seconds](https://youtu.be/tomUWcQ0P3k?si=CJwZJ7UaqpynDU-d) on YouTube. You can also find a step-by-step example applied to the EWC on the [official EWC documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/x/2EDOIQ).

        >💡 This template can be deployed in combination with complementary infrastructure as part of the [Default Stack Provisioning](https://europeanweather.cloud/community-hub/default-stack-provisioning) Community Hub Item.

          <ID or name of the OpenStack Subnet attached to the IPA server>
        ```
        Then remove any default DNS nameservers which where added to the subnet prior to the IPA server configuration:

        ```bash
        openstack subnet unset \
          --dns-nameserver <IPV4 address of any prior default DNS nameserver> \
          <ID or name of the OpenStack Subnet attached to the IPA server>
        ```

        The default Authenticator uses PAM (Pluggable Authentication Module) to authenticate system users with their usernames and passwords.
        With the default Authenticator, any user with an account and password on the system will be allowed to login.
        See also [here](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/5.2.1/tutorial/getting-started/authenticators-users-basics.html)

        Therefore in order to login you need to use username/password from a local user existing in the machine.

        >💡 Not to be confused with Nginx, the web server and reverse proxy.

         This Ansible Playbook configures an existing virtual machine running
         within the [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/), to operate as a [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) server.

         Nginx Proxy Manager is full-featured tool that helps to lower the barriers to entry for users who are interested in learning and working with [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) servers.

         ## Functionality
         * Virtual host management
         * Ability to cache assets
         * Blocking of common exploits
         * Websocket support
         * Access list configuration
         * SSL and HTTP/2 support
         * Host redirection with HTTP code configuration
         * TCP and UDP stream support
         * User management
         * Nginx Proxy
         * Manager log auditing

         ## Prerequisites
         > ⚠️ Only Ubuntu version 24 and 22 supported due to constrains imposed by [dependencies](#dependencies).

         > 💡 A VM plan with at least 8GB of RAM is recommended for successful setup and
         stable operation.

         * Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (version 2.0 or higher )
         * Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads) (version 3.9 or higher)
         * Install [ansible](https://pypi.org/project/ansible) (version 2.15 or higher)
         * Get OpenStack API credentials (see [How to request OpenStack Application Credentials](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+How+to+request+Openstack+Application+Credentials) section of the EWC documentation)
         * If you plan to configure an existing VM, jump to the [Usage](#usage) section below
         * If you have not yet provisioned a VM, it is required to do so. You may choose one of the following approaches:
           * A) Provision a new VM via UI:
             * Create an SSH keypair (see [Creating the keys](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Add+your+SSH+key+pair+to+Morpheus#AddyourSSHkeypairtoMorpheus-Creatingthekeys) section of the EWC documentation)
             * Import the SSH public key into Morpheus (see [Adding the keys in Morpheus](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Add+your+SSH+key+pair+to+Morpheus#AddyourSSHkeypairtoMorpheus-AddingthekeysinMorpheus) section of the EWC documentation)
             * Provision a new VM through the web portal (see [Provision a new Instance - Web](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Provision+a+new+instance+-+web) section of the EWC) documentation

             OR
           * B) Provision a new VM via CLI:
             * Create an SSH keypair (see [Creating the keys](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Add+your+SSH+key+pair+to+Morpheus#AddyourSSHkeypairtoMorpheus-Creatingthekeys) section of the EWC documentation)
             * Add you SSH public key to OpenStack (see [Import SSH Key](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+OpenStack+Command-Line+client#EWCOpenStackCommandLineclient-ImportSSHkey) section of the EWC documentation).
             * Provision a new VM via the OpenStack CLI (see [How to create a VM using the OpenStack CLI](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+How+to+create+a+VM+using+the+Openstack+CLI) section of the EWC documentation)

         ## Usage

         ### 1. Clone the repository

         ```bash
         git clone https://github.com/ewcloud/ewc-ansible-playbook-flavours-and-provisioning.git
         ```

         #### 1.1. Change to the specific Item's subdirectory

         ```bash
         cd ewc-ansible-playbook-flavours-and-provisioning/playbooks/nginx-proxy-manager-flavour
         ```

         #### 1.2. (Optional) Checkout an specific Item's version
         >⚠️ Make sure to replace `x.y.z` in the command below, with your version of preference.

         ```bash
         git checkout x.y.z
         ```

         ### 2. Download  Ansible dependencies
         >💡 By default, Ansible Roles are installed under the `~/.ansible/roles` directory within your working environment.

         Download the correct version of the Ansible dependencies, if you haven't done so already:

         ```
         ansible-galaxy role install -r requirements.yml
         ```

         ### 3. Specify the target host and SSH credentials
         Create an inventory file to specify address/credentials that Ansible should use
         to reach the virtual machine you wish to configure:

         ```yaml
         # inventory.yml
         ---
         ewcloud:
           hosts:
             nginx_proxy_manager:
               ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
               ansible_host: <add the IPV4 address of the target host>
               ansible_ssh_private_key_file: <add the path to local SSH private key file>
               ansible_user: ubuntu
               ansible_ssh_common_args: -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new
         ```

         ### 4. Configure and apply the template

         #### 4.1. Interactive Mode

         By running the following command, you can trigger an interactive session that
         prompts you for the necessary user inputs, and then applies changes to your
         target EWC environment:

         ```bash
         ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml nginx-proxy-manager-flavour.yml
         ```

         #### 4.2. Non-Interactive Mode

         >💡 To learn more about defining variables at runtime, checkout the
         [official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html).

         You can also run in non-interactive mode by passing the
         `--extra-vars` or `-e` flag, followed by a map of  key-value pairs; one for
         each and every available input (see [inputs section](#inputs) below). For
         example:

         ```bash
         ansible-playbook \
           -i inventory.yml \
           -e "npm_admin_ui_port=8080" \
           -e "os_security_group_name=nginx-proxy-manager" \
           nginx-proxy-manager-flavour.yml
         ```

         ## Inputs
         > ⛔ If deploying to an instance on the ECMWF site, using a high port numbers such as in the example above will prevent you from accessing the Nginx Proxy Manager UI from the pubic internet, even when a valid security group is attached to the instance. This is due to the outer perimeter firewall of the ECMWF site. For details see [EWC Security guidelines - Restrictive firewall (allow-listing)](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+Security+guidelines#EWCSecurityguidelines-Restrictivefirewall(allow-listing)).

         | Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
         |------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
         | npm_admin_ui_port | port number at which the Nginx Proxy Manager admin UI is served | `number` | `8080`  | yes |
         | os_security_group_name | OpenStack security group containing all firewall rules required for Nginx Proxy Manager operation  | `string` | `nginx-proxy-manager` | yes |

        Accessing NWC SAF buckets with kerchunk/virtualizarr/icechunk

        ## Description

        This project is a collection of notebooks that demonstrate how to build virtual data cubes from NWC SAF data buckets. It focuses specifically on the bucket containing NWC SAF GEO outputs hosted on the European Weather Cloud (EWC). The bucket used is a precursor to the future MTG format of NWC SAF, containing files with a time dimension. This bucket is publicly accessible within the EWC infrastructure. The bucket name is:

        `nwc-saf.0-degree.level-2-cf`

        ⚠️ Important: These notebooks are designed to be executed inside the EWC environment.
        Please consider that these notebook should be executed inside the EWC.

        Playbooks to install and configure Pytroll-based satellite data processing pipelines and optionally a WMS server. These playbooks are used in the European Weather Cloud (EWC) environment.

        ## Overview

        `ewc-playbooks` provides **Ansible playbooks** to set up a robust, containerized environment for processing satellite data using the **Pytroll** ecosystem. Supported datasets include:

        - **FCI** – Flexible Combined Imager (MTG-I)
        - **SEVIRI** – Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG)
        - **VIIRS** – Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NOAA/NASA)

        Optionally, a **WMS server** can be deployed to serve processed imagery for visualization in GIS clients.

        **Key features:**

        - Automated provisioning of multiple containers.
        - Scalable and isolated pipelines for each satellite sensor.
        - Integration with [Pytroll tools](https://pytroll.github.io/) for reading, processing, and resampling satellite data.
        - Optional WMS server for serving processed data.

        - **`defaults.yml`**: Default variables.
        - **`satellite-data-processing-main.yaml`**: Main playbook orchestrating all deployments.

        ## Tested Platforms

        This playbook and container setup have been tested on the following platforms:

        | Operating System | Version       |
        |-----------------|---------------|
        | Ubuntu          | 22.04 LTS     |
        | Ubuntu          | 24.04 LTS     |
        | Rocky Linux     | 9             |

        > Note: Other Linux distributions may work but have not been officially tested.

        ## Run the Playbook

        1. Install Ansible

        You can install Ansible and other Python dependencies in a virtual environment:

        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        pip install ansible
        ```

        For more details, see the Ansible installation guide: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html

        2. Define Your Inventory

        Create the inventory file to list your hosts and groups. Example:

        ```bash
        [satellite_hosts]
        localhost ansible_connection=local
        ```

        3. Run the main playbook (or any specific playbook) using:

        ```bash
        ansible-playbook -i inventory satellite-data-processing-main.yaml
        ```

        This will:
        - Build and launch containers for processing FCI, SEVIRI, and VIIRS data.
        - Optionally deploy WMS containers to serve processed outputs.

        ### Optional Variables

        You can customize the playbook behavior using the following variables:

        | Variable                | Default Value | Description                                           |
        |-------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
        | `satellite_data_type`   | `fci`         | Specify the satellite type to process (`fci`, `seviri`, `viirs`) |

        ### Passing Variables to Ansible

        You can override these defaults when running the playbook by using the `--extra-vars` (`-e`) flag:

        ```bash
        ansible-playbook -i inventory path/to/playbook/filename.yaml -e "satellite_data_type=seviri"
        ```

        This Ansible Playbook configures virtual machines within the
        [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/) to
        operate as a remote desktops, courtesy of [X2Go](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php).

        X2Go enables secure, graphical access to a desktop environment over low
        or high bandwidth connections, providing a seamless user experience for
        remote work. This template equips your VM with utility software you
        would expect to see in a typical and stable Linux distribution, ideal
        efficient and intuitive desktop operation.

        Special for tenant users needing remote graphical access in their EWC
        environment, this template simplifies the setup of basic cloud development
        solution. Follow the [instructions below](#usage) to get started.

        ## Functionality
        The template is designed to:
        - Configure a pre-existing Rocky Linux virtual machine (minimum 4GB RAM recommended) with
        the [MATE desktop environment](https://mate-desktop.org/).
        - Install and set up X2Go for secure remote desktop access over varying network conditions.
        - Enable end-users to interact with the VM through a graphical interface using the X2Go client
        application.

        ## Prerequisites
        > ⚠️ Only RockyLinux version 9 and 8 supported due to constrains imposed by [dependencies](#dependencies).

        > 💡 A VM plan with at least 4GB of RAM is recommended for successful setup and

        ## Usage

        ### 1. Clone the repository

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/ewcloud/ewc-ansible-playbook-flavours-and-provisioning.git
        ```

        #### 1.1. Change to the specific Item's subdirectory

        ```bash
        cd ewc-ansible-playbook-flavours-and-provisioning/playbooks/remote-desktop-flavour
        ```

        #### 1.2. (Optional) Checkout an specific Item's version
        >⚠️ Make sure to replace `x.y.z` in the command below, with your version of preference.

        ```bash
        git checkout x.y.z
        ```


        ### 2. Download  Ansible dependencies
        >💡 By default, Ansible Roles are installed under the `~/.ansible/roles` directory within your working environment.

        Download the correct version of the Ansible dependencies, if you haven't done so already:

        ```
        ansible-galaxy role install -r requirements.yml
        ```

        ### 3. Specify the target host and SSH credentials
        Create an inventory file to specify address/credentials that Ansible should use
        to reach the virtual machine you wish to configure:

        ```yaml
        # inventory.yml
        ---
        ewcloud:
          hosts:
            remote_desktop:
              ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
              ansible_host: <add the IPV4 address of the target host>
              ansible_ssh_private_key_file: <add the path to local SSH private key file>
              ansible_user: cloud-user
              ansible_ssh_common_args: -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new

        ```

        ### 4. Configure and apply the template

        #### 4.1. Interactive Mode

        By running the following command, you can trigger an interactive session that
        prompts you for the necessary user inputs, and then applies changes to your
        target EWC environment:

        ```bash
        ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml remote-desktop-flavour.yml
        ```

        #### 4.2. Non-Interactive Mode

        >💡 To learn more about defining variables at runtime, checkout the
        [official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html).

        You can also run in non-interactive mode by passing the
        `--extra-vars` or `-e` flag, followed by a map of  key-value pairs; one for
        each and every available input (see [inputs section](#inputs) below). For
        example:

        ```bash
        ansible-playbook \
          -i inventory.yml \
          -e '{"fail2ban_whitelisted_ip_ranges": ""}' \
          remote-desktop-flavour.yml
        ```

        ### 5. Install the local client and connect to your remote desktop
        >⚠️ When configuring a connection, be sure to select "MATE" (instead of
        "KDE" or any other options) in the `Session Type` drop-down list, towards the
        bottom of the `Session` tab. This is required for the local client to correctly
        communicate with your remote desktop.

        Install the remote desktop client on Microsoft Window, Mac OS or Linux by
        following the links on the [official X2Go installation page](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:installation:x2goclient). Then follow the [official X2Go client usage page](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:usage:x2goclient)
        if you do not know how to configure a new session.

        For a session creation
        example, representative of a typical EWC environment, checkout the Remote
        Desktop section of
        [this official EWC documentation page](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EUMETSAT+tenancy%3A+Default+setup).

        >✅ This template can be safely applied from any local work environment, even running outside an EWC tenancy's private network.

        The remote desktop is a regular RockyLinux instance equipped with [X2Go](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php).
        It enables you to access a graphical desktop computer running in your remote
        instance of choice, over a low bandwidth (or high bandwidth) connection.
        This means that you can connect to it via the
        [X2Go client](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:installation:x2goclient)
        to enjoy a regular desktop user experience.

        This is a configuration template
        (i.e. an [Ansible Playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks.html))
        to customize your environment in the
        [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/).

        ## Functionality

        The template is designed to:

        * Provision an instance via [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform),
        with your specified Linux distribution and desired flavor (a.k.a VM plan):
          * If a `terraform.tfstate` [state file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state)
          is not found under the user-defined directory, attempts to create the
          instance from scratch

            OR
          * If  `terraform.tfstate` file is found, leverages Terraform's out-of-the-box
            functionality to update the instance referenced on it
        * Configure the existing or newly provisioned instance such that it:
          * Enables users to operate the remote hosts through a graphical desktop
            (i.e. a [MATE desktop environment](https://mate-desktop.org/)), over a low or high bandwidth connection.

        After successful provisioning, you can leverage Terraform's functionality to modify or delete individual components safely. Each will have its own `main.tf` definition and `terraform.tfstate` state file under the corresponding user-defined local directories.

        To learn the basics about managing infrastructure with Terraform, check out [Terraform in 100 seconds](https://youtu.be/tomUWcQ0P3k?si=CJwZJ7UaqpynDU-d) on YouTube. You can also find a step-by-step example applied to the EWC on the [official EWC documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/x/2EDOIQ).

        #### 1.1. Change to the specific Item's subdirectory

        ```bash
        cd ewc-ansible-playbook-flavours-and-provisioning/playbooks/remote-desktop-provisioning
        ```

        #### 1.2. (Optional) Checkout an specific Item's version
        >⚠️ Make sure to replace `x.y.z` in the command below, with your version of preference.

        ```bash
        git checkout x.y.z
        ```

        ### 2. Download  Ansible dependencies
        >💡 By default, Ansible Roles are installed under the `~/.ansible/roles` directory within your working environment.

        Download the correct version of the Ansible dependencies, if you haven't done so already:

        ```
        ansible-galaxy role install -r requirements.yml
        ```

        ### 3. Configure and apply the template

        #### 3.1. Interactive Mode

        By running the following command, you can trigger an interactive session that
        prompts you for the necessary user inputs, and then applies changes to your
        target EWC environment:

        ```bash
        ansible-playbook remote-desktop-provisioning.yml
        ```

        #### 3.2. Non-Interactive Mode

        >💡 To learn more about defining variables at runtime, checkout the
        [official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html).

        You can also run in non-interactive mode by passing the
        `--extra-vars` or `-e` flag, followed by a map of  key-value pairs; one for
        each and every available input (see [inputs section](#inputs) below). For example:

        ```bash
        ansible-playbook \
          -e '{
                "ewc_provider":"eumetsat",
                "remote_desktop_tf_project_path":"~/ewc/remote-desktop-1",
                "remote_desktop_app_name":"remote",
                "remote_desktop_instance_name":"desktop",
                "remote_desktop_instance_index":1,
                "remote_desktop_flavor_name":"eo1.large",
                "remote_desktop_image_name":"Rocky-9.5-20250604142417",
                "remote_desktop_instance_has_fip":"no",
                "public_keypair_name":"my-public-key-name",
                "private_keypair_path":"~/.ssh/id_rsa",
                "private_network_name":"private",
                "security_group_name":"ssh",
                "fail2ban_whitelisted_ip_ranges":""
            }' \
          remote-desktop-provisioning.yml
        ```

        ### 4. Install the local client and connect to your remote desktop
        >⚠️ When configuring a connection, be sure to select "MATE" (instead of
        "KDE" or any other options) in the `Session Type` drop-down list, towards the
        bottom of the `Session` tab. This is required for the local client to correctly
        communicate with your remote desktop.

        Install the remote desktop client on Microsoft Window, Mac OS or Linux by
        following the links on the [official X2Go installation page](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:installation:x2goclient). Then follow the [official X2Go client usage page](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:usage:x2goclient)
        if you do not know how to configure a new session.

        For a session creation
        example, representative of a typical EWC environment, checkout the Remote
        Desktop section of
        [this official EWC documentation page](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EUMETSAT+tenancy%3A+Default+setup).

        The [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) bastion or proxy server
        is a barrier between your internal machines (which lack a public or floating IP
        address) and the public internet. With the SSH proxy, you'll have an extra layer of
        security on top of your instances. It's equipped with
        [Fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban),
        intrusion prevention software designed to prevent brute-force attacks.

        This template is for tenant admins wishing to hardening the way tenant users
        connect to the [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/),
        as well as tenant users whom are mindful about safe-keeping the compute resources
        or data withing their work environments.

        ## Functionality
        The template is designed to:

        * Configure a pre-existing virtual machine running RockyLinux, with public IP
        address, and a minimum recommended 4GB of RAM, as entrypoint for users who
        wish to reach private EWC networks, from the public internet, via SSH.

        ## Prerequisites
        > ⚠️ Only RockyLinux versions 9 or 8 are supported due
        to constrains imposed by [dependencies](#dependencies).

        > 💡 A VM plan with at least 4GB of RAM is recommended for successful setup and
        stable operation.

        * Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (version 2.0 or higher )
        * Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads) (version 3.9 or higher)
        * Install [ansible](https://pypi.org/project/ansible) (version 2.15 or higher)
        * If you plan to configure an existing VM, jump to the [Usage](#usage) section below
        * If you have not yet provisioned a VM, it is required to do so. You may choose one of the following approaches:
          * A) Provision a new VM via UI:
            * Create an SSH keypair (see [Creating the keys](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Add+your+SSH+key+pair+to+Morpheus#AddyourSSHkeypairtoMorpheus-Creatingthekeys) section of the EWC documentation)
            * Import the SSH public key into Morpheus (see [Adding the keys in Morpheus](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Add+your+SSH+key+pair+to+Morpheus#AddyourSSHkeypairtoMorpheus-AddingthekeysinMorpheus) section of the EWC documentation)
            * Provision a new VM through the web portal (see [Provision a new Instance - Web](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Provision+a+new+instance+-+web) section of the EWC) documentation

            OR
          * B) Provision a new VM via CLI:
            * Create an SSH keypair (see [Creating the keys](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Add+your+SSH+key+pair+to+Morpheus#AddyourSSHkeypairtoMorpheus-Creatingthekeys) section of the EWC documentation)
            * Add you SSH public key to OpenStack (see [Import SSH Key](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+OpenStack+Command-Line+client#EWCOpenStackCommandLineclient-ImportSSHkey) section of the EWC documentation).
            * Provision a new VM via the OpenStack CLI (see [How to create a VM using the OpenStack CLI](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+How+to+create+a+VM+using+the+Openstack+CLI) section of the EWC documentation)

            OR
          * C) Deploy this template, together with a new VM, as part of the [SSH Bastion Provisioning Community Hub Item](https://europeanweather.cloud/community-hub/ssh-bastion-provisioning)

            OR
          * D) Deploy this template, together with a new VM, via the [EWCCLI](https://pypi.org/project/ewccli/)

        The [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) proxy or bastion server
        is a barrier between your internal machines (without public or floating IPs)
        and the public internet. With the SSH proxy, you'll have an extra layer of
        security on top of your instances. It's equipped with
        [Fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban),
        intrusion prevention software designed to prevent brute-force attacks.

        This is a configuration template
        (i.e. an [Ansible Playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks.html))
        to customize your environment in the
        [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/).

        ## Functionality

        The template is designed to:

        * Provision an instance via [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform),
        with your specified Linux distribution and desired flavor (a.k.a VM plan):
          * If a `terraform.tfstate` [state file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state)
          is not found under the user-defined directory, attempts to create the
          instance from scratch

            OR
          * If  `terraform.tfstate` file is found, leverages Terraform's out-of-the-box functionality to update the instance referenced on it
        * Configure the existing or newly provisioned RockyLinux virtual machines (with
        public IP address), as entrypoint for users who wish to reach private EWC networks
        from the public internet via SSH.

        After successful provisioning, you can leverage Terraform's functionality to modify or delete individual components safely. Each will have its own `main.tf` definition and `terraform.tfstate` state file under the corresponding user-defined local directories.

        To learn the basics about managing infrastructure with Terraform, check out [Terraform in 100 seconds](https://youtu.be/tomUWcQ0P3k?si=CJwZJ7UaqpynDU-d) on YouTube. You can also find a step-by-step example applied to the EWC on the [official EWC documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/x/2EDOIQ).

        ## Prerequisites

        * Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (version 2.0 or higher )
        * Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads) (version 3.9 or higher)
        * Install [ansible](https://pypi.org/project/ansible) (version 2.15 or higher)
        * Install [terraform](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+IaC+via+Terraform+and+OpenTofu#EWCIaCviaTerraformandOpenTofu-InstallationoftheCLI) (version 1.0 or higher)
        * Get OpenStack API credentials (see [How to request OpenStack Application Credentials](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+How+to+request+Openstack+Application+Credentials) section of the EWC documentation)
        * Create an SSH keypair (see [Creating Keys](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Add+your+SSH+key+pair+to+Morpheus#AddyourSSHkeypairtoMorpheus-Creatingthekeys) section of the EWC documentation)
        * Import your public SSH key to OpenStack (see [Import SSH Key](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+OpenStack+Command-Line+client#EWCOpenStackCommandLineclient-ImportSSHkey) section of the EWC documentation).

        ## Usage
        > ⚠️ Only RockyLinux version 9 and 8 supported due to constrains imposed by [dependencies](#dependencies).

        > 💡 A VM plan with at least 4GB of RAM is recommended for successful setup and
