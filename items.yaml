        # IPA client enrollment flavour

        This Ansible Playbook configures an existing virtual machine in the
        [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/) to operate as a
        client of [IPA services](../ipa-server-flavour/).

        IPA provides integrated identity management and DNS services, enabling
        centralized user authentication, authorization, and resource discovery. 

        Suitable for tenant admins and tenant users alike, this template simplifies the
        integration of VMs into a [FreeIPA](https://www.freeipa.org/page/Main_Page)-managed
        fleet of instances within the EWC environment. Follow the [instructions below](#usage)
        to enroll your instance.

        For more information on how to work with an LDAP user account after VM
        enrollment, checkout the [official EWC documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/Creating+new+Morpheus+and+LDAP+users).

        ## Functionality
        The template is designed to:
        - Configure a pre-existing virtual machine running Rocky Linux 8/9 or Ubuntu to connect to a
        IPA server on the same subnet.
        - Enable DNS resolution for discovering private hosts and public addresses.
        - Allow remote access to the VM using centrally managed LDAP users via password authentication.

        ## Usage

        ### 1. Specify the target host and SSH credentials
        > 💡 To find out which is the default user for your chosen VM image,
        checkout the [official EWC documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+VM+images+and+default+users).

        Create an inventory file to specify address/credentials that Ansible should use
        to reach the virtual machine you wish to configure:

        ```yaml
        # inventory.yml
        ---
        ewcloud:
          hosts:
            ipa_client:
              ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
              ansible_host: <add the IPV4 address of the target host>
              ansible_ssh_private_key_file: <add the path to local SSH private key file>
              ansible_user: <add the default user according to your chosen VM image>
              ansible_ssh_common_args: -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new

        ```

        ### 2. Configure and apply the template

        #### 2.1. Interactive Mode

        By running the following command, you can trigger an interactive session that
        prompts you for the necessary user inputs, and then applies changes to your
        target EWC environment:

        ```bash
        ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml ipa-client-enroll-flavour.yml
        ```

        #### 2.2. Non-Interactive Mode

        >💡 To learn more about defining variables at runtime, checkout the
        [official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html).

        You can also run in non-interactive mode by passing the
        `--extra-vars` or `-e` flag, followed by a map of  key-value pairs; one for
        each and every available input (see [inputs section](#inputs) below). For
        example:

        ```bash
        ansible-playbook \
          -i inventory.yml \
          -e '{
                "ipa_client_hostname": "ipa-client-1",
                "ipa_domain": "eumetsat.sandbox.ewc",

        # IPA client disenrollment flavour

        This Ansible Playbook configures an existing virtual machine in the
        [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/) to disenroll
        from a [IPA server](../ipa-server-flavour/).

        IPA provides integrated identity management and DNS services for centralized
        user authentication, authorization, and resource discovery. This template safely
        removes a VM from a [FreeIPA](https://www.freeipa.org/page/Main_Page)-managed
        environment, which is essential when decommissioning infrastructure to prevent
        stale entries in the IPA directory such as obsolete host records, and DNS 
        pointers, that could lead to management overhead, naming conflicts or security
        vulnerabilities from lingering credentials.

        Suitable for both tenant admin and tenant users, this template streamlines client
        removal, ensuring a clean and efficient identity system. The end benefit for 
        users is reduced administrative burden, improved security posture,
        and easier scaling or redeployment of resources. 

        ## Functionality
        The template is designed to:
        - Configure a pre-existing virtual machine, previously enrolled (likely with help of the [IPA client](../ipa-client-enroll-flavour/) template) to disconnect from an [IPA server](../ipa-server-flavour/).
        - Disable user authentication and authorization (LDAP) for the target instance.
        - Remove IPA server-internal DNS records referencing the target instance, if present.



        ## Usage

        ### 1. Specify the target host and SSH credentials
        > 💡 To find out which is the default user for your chosen VM image,
        checkout the [official EWC documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+VM+images+and+default+users).

        Create an inventory file to specify address/credentials that Ansible should use
        to reach the virtual machine you wish to configure:

        ```yaml
        # inventory.yml
        ---
        ewcloud:
          hosts:
            ipa_client:
              ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
              ansible_host: <add the IPV4 address of the target host>
              ansible_ssh_private_key_file: <add the path to local SSH private key file>
              ansible_user: <add the default user according to your chosen VM image>
              ansible_ssh_common_args: -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new

        ```

        ### 2. Configure and apply the template

        #### 2.1. Interactive Mode

        By running the following command, you can trigger an interactive session that
        prompts you for the necessary user inputs, and then applies changes to your
        target EWC environment:

        ```bash
        ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml ipa-client-disenroll-flavour.yml
        ```

        #### 2.2. Non-Interactive Mode

        >💡 To learn more about defining variables at runtime, checkout the
        [official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html).

        You can also run in non-interactive mode by passing the
        `--extra-vars` or `-e` flag, followed by a map of  key-value pairs; one for
        each and every available input (see [inputs section](#inputs) below). For
        example:

        ```bash
        ansible-playbook \
          -i inventory.yml \
          -e '{
              "ipa_domain": "eumetsat.sandbox.ewc",
              "ipa_client_hostname": "ipa-client-1",
              "ipa_server_hostname": "ipa-server-1",
              "ipa_admin_username": "ipaadmin",
              "ipa_admin_password": "my-secret-password"
            }' \
          ipa-client-disenroll-flavour.yml
        ```

        ## Inputs

        | Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
        |------|-------------|------|---------|----------|
        | ipa_domain | domain name managed by the IPA server. Example: `eumetsat.sandbox.ewc` | `string` | n/a | yes |
        | ipa_client_hostname | hostname of the target vm to be disenrolled from the IPA server. Example: `ipa-client-1` | `string` | n/a | yes |
        | ipa_server_hostname | hostname of the IPA server. Example: `ipa-server-1` | `string` | n/a | yes |

        # IPA server flavour

        This Ansible Playbook configures an existing virtual machine running
        within the [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/)
        to operate as a [FreeIPA](https://www.freeipa.org/page/Main_Page) server.

        IPA (acronym for identity, policy and audit), provides integrated identity
        management and DNS services, enabling centralized user authentication, authorization,
        and resource discovery.

        Ideal for tenant administrators, this template simplifies the setup
        of a secure, open-source identity and DNS solution in the EWC environment. 

        For information on how to manage the life-cycle of an IPA server or its
        replicas, checkout the [official EWC documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EUMETSAT+-+Configure+LDAP).

        ## Functionality
        The template is designed to:
        * Validate that network/subnet configuration in the EWC tenancy
        * Configure a pre-existing virtual machine running RockyLinux version 8 or 9,
        and with a minimum recommended 4GB of RAM, such that it:
          * Provides DNS resolutions for discovery of resources (i.e. other virtual
          machines)
          * Enables centralized user and credentials creation/edition/deletion/authentication
          * Allows centralized authorization between users and resources
        * Automatically update the underlying subnet DNS nameserver to point to the
        newly configured IPA server

        ## Usage

        ### 1. Specify the target host and SSH credentials
        Create an inventory file to specify address/credentials that Ansible should use
        to reach the virtual machine you wish to configure:

        ```yaml
        # inventory.yml
        ---
        ewcloud:
          hosts:
            ipa_server:
              ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
              ansible_host: <add the IPV4 address of the target host>
              ansible_ssh_private_key_file: <add the path to local SSH private key file>
              ansible_user: cloud-user 
              ansible_ssh_common_args: -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new
        ```

        ### 2. Configure and apply the template

        #### 2.1. Interactive Mode

        By running the following command, you can trigger an interactive session that
        prompts you for the necessary user inputs, and then applies changes to your
        target EWC environment:

        ```bash
        ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml ipa-server-flavour.yml

        # Remote desktop flavour

        This Ansible Playbook configures virtual machines within the
        [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/) to 
        operate as a remote desktops, courtesy of [X2Go](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php).

        X2Go enables secure, graphical access to a desktop environment over low
        or high bandwidth connections, providing a seamless user experience for 
        remote work. This template equips your VM with utility software you
        would expect to see in a typical and stable Linux distribution, ideal 
        efficient and intuitive desktop operation.

        Special for tenant users needing remote graphical access in their EWC 
        environment, this template simplifies the setup of basic cloud development
        solution. 

        If you need an example on how to connect to the remote desktop after the
        initial setup is complete, checkout the 
        [official EWC documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EUMETSAT+tenancy%3A+Default+setup).

        ## Functionality
        The template is designed to:
        - Configure a pre-existing Rocky Linux virtual machine (minimum 4GB RAM recommended) with 
        the [MATE desktop environment](https://mate-desktop.org/).
        - Install and set up X2Go for secure remote desktop access over varying network conditions.
        - Enable end-users to interact with the VM through a graphical interface using the 
        [X2Go client](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:installation:x2goclient) application.


        ## Usage

        ### 1. Specify the target host and SSH credentials
        Create an inventory file to specify address/credentials that Ansible should use
        to reach the virtual machine you wish to configure:

        ```yaml
        # inventory.yml
        ---
        ewcloud:
          hosts:
            remote_desktop:
              ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
              ansible_host: <add the IPV4 address of the target host>
              ansible_ssh_private_key_file: <add the path to local SSH private key file>
              ansible_user: cloud-user
              ansible_ssh_common_args: -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new

        ```

        ### 2. Configure and apply the template

        #### 2.1. Interactive Mode

        By running the following command, you can trigger an interactive session that
        prompts you for the necessary user inputs, and then applies changes to your
        target EWC environment:

        ```bash
        ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml remote-desktop-flavour.yml
        ```

        #### 2.2. Non-Interactive Mode

        >💡 To learn more about defining variables at runtime, checkout the
        [official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html).

        You can also run in non-interactive mode by passing the
        `--extra-vars` or `-e` flag, followed by a map of  key-value pairs; one for
        each and every available input (see [inputs section](#inputs) below). For
        example:

        ```bash
        ansible-playbook \
          -i inventory.yml \
          -e '{"whitelisted_ip_ranges": ["10.0.0.0/24"]}' \
          remote-desktop-flavour.yml
        ```

        | Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
        |------|-------------|------|---------|----------|
        | whitelisted_ip_ranges | IPv4 ranges (in CIDR format) to be whitelisted in Fail2ban configuration. When in doubt, do not set. Example: `['10.0.0.0/24','192.168.1.0/24']` | `list(string)` | n/a | no |


        ## Requirements

        > ⚠️ Only RockyLinux 8.10 instances are currently supported due
        to constrains imposed by the required ewc-ansible-role-remote-desktop Ansible
        Role.

        > 💡 A VM plan with at least 4GB of RAM is recommended for successful setup and
        stable operation.

        # SSH bastion flavour
        The [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) bastion or proxy server
        is a barrier between your internal machines (which lack a public or floating IP
        address) and the public internet. With the SSH proxy, you'll have an extra layer of 
        security on top of your instances. It's equipped with 
        [Fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban),
        intrusion prevention software designed to prevent brute-force attacks.

        This template is for tenant admins wishing to hardening the way tenant users
        connect to the [European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/),
        as well as tenant users whom are mindful about safe-keeping the compute resources 
        or data withing their work environments. 

        For details on how to connect to a VM covered behind the SSH bastion,
        checkout the [official EWC documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EUMETSAT+tenancy%3A+Default+setup).

        ## Functionality
        The template is designed to:

        * Configure a pre-existing virtual machine running RockyLinux, with public IP 
        address, and a minimum recommended 4GB of RAM, as entrypoint for users who 
        wish to reach private EWC networks, from the public internet, via SSH.

        ## Usage

        ### 1. Specify the target host and SSH credentials
        Create an inventory file to specify address/credentials that Ansible should use
        to reach the virtual machine you wish to configure:

        ```yaml
        # inventory.yml
        ---
        ewcloud:

              ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
              ansible_host: <add the IPV4 address of the target host>
              ansible_ssh_private_key_file: <add the path to local SSH private key file>
              ansible_user: cloud-user
